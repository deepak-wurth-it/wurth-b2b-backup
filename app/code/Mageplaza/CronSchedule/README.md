## 4. Highlight Features

### Monitor all cronjobs at the admin panel

From the backend, store admins can track and manage the scheduled cron jobs from a separate listing grid. It is flexible to access the grid to monitor cron jobs details including cron job code, group name, activation status, instance classpath, job method, time schedule, and action. The cron jobs grid provides an overview of all available cron tasks. Admins can make a quick edit to the cron jobs created before from this grid.

Admins can also perform mass actions on cron tasks or on selected ones, including deleting, changing the status of cron tasks without any difficulties. 


### Record all states of a cron task

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/NxfsmV6.png)

Another outstanding feature of Cron Schedule is that it allows recording and updating all status of a cron task in History Log. 

Store admins will be notified by the Cron Jobs Log when there are action states, including Error, Missed, Pending, Running, and Success. If there are any problems, a message showing all details of errors will be displayed on the log. Admins can reconfigure to solve the problem. 

### Make cron tasks visual in a timetable

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Vs9Cv0c.png)

It is necessary to arrange and display cron jobs with different schedule time and status in an easy-to-follow and logical way, which helps store admins to manage the cron jobs grid easily. Cron Timetable and Table wisely display all cron tasks in chronological order with fully setting dates and time of each cron task. 

Notably, each of the cron tasks is set up along with a specific color bar showing the visual status, which makes it easier for store admins to identify the state. For example, red color illustrates errors, blue color for pending, purple for running, and green for success. In case, tasks affect each other; admin can easily define and timely modify them. 

### Manually carry out cron jobs
